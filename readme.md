# About this project

This is a working document. We want to visualize the following:

* Row 1: text description of my affliction
* Row 2 tabsets:
  - tab 1:
    - top: sleep rating over time annotated with events (palpatations, alcohol, panic, pills), weekly average, DOW, predicted values
    - bottom: Gant chart of daily sleep hours (annotated)
    - underneath: calendar strip -- hover over it to see the log entry for the day
  - tab 2:
    - facetted time series of sleep rating, hours of sleep, alcohol, temperature
  - tab 3:
    - snapshot stats: average hours last week, average sleep rating last week, average times woken up last week, average time of the first awake phase, average times woken up, average mins to fall asleep (make the average conditional on a filter, so that you can select N days to average over)
    - tab 4:
      - Forecast: predicting sleep rating for next day and trying to explain it
