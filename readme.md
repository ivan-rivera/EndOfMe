# About this project

I'm suffering from insomnia and at some stage I decided to start tracking my sleep. Over a month later I ended up with a small dataset and I thought that it might be a good idea to visualize it and track it over time, perhaps it'll reveal some patterns that I'll be able to act upon.

This dashboard can be viewed on this [RPubs page](http://rpubs.com/de1pher/insomnia).
